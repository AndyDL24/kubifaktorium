# The general format of the localization file for each line is <key> = <value>, for example "UI.BuildTrain = Build train". The <key> must not be changed, the <value> is to be translated, so e.g. "UI.BuildTrain = Baue Zug".
# A line starting with "#" is ignored and can be used for comments. 
# The line "fallback=English" specifies which language to use when a certain string cannot be found. Usually English is a good choice as it is usually the most up-to-date but other languages can be chosen if they are closer to the target language. 
# The game supports hyphenation for languages with long strings like German. To use it, use the "_" character to insert a soft hyphen at the spots where a word can be hyphenated. I recommend this for words longer than 12-15 characters. For example: "Recommen_dations" or "trans_portation".
# A string in the format "#<id>#" causes an icon to be inserted, e.g. "#sun#". Note that the id must not be translated, otherwise it will not be found and translated correctly.
# A string in the format "##<id>" creates a keyword. Keywords like "##daytime" will be translated to an underlined word "daytime". In addition, an explanation will be added underneath, usually in the tooltips. Again, the id must not be translated. However, the explanation text (the lines with keys like ##idle), should.
# Strings like "$1", "$2" etc are placeholders for numbers and other things which will be filled by the game. For example "Growth rate at daytime: $1%" will become "Growth rate at daytime: 75%" at runtime. 
# If required for some reason, you can use <br> to create a line break. However I recommend not using it.       
# Whenever you start the game with a new translation file, it will auto_matically create a list of the missing translation lines. This is both useful to get started and to keep the translation up-to-date when new strings get added. The file can be found in C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\MirkoStudio\Kubifaktorium\Missing_<language>.txt on Windows or ~/.config/unity3d/MirkoStudio/Kubifaktorium/ on Linux.

# Finished translations can be shared and synced on: https://github.com/Vandorr/kubifaktorium
# Visit us on discord.gg/kubifaktorium to get access and share the localization work with other friendly humans. :)
