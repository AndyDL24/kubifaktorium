Here are some general tips for the current version: <br>- I recommend playing the tutorials to get started.<br> - The grassland and desert biomes are quite playable. Everything beyond (automation, conveyor belts etc.) is early in development. To learn more, have a look at the game's road map. <br> - When playing the campaign, please save the game every time you come back to the world map. <br> - If you encounter a bug, please report it using the in-game reporting tool (button in the top right). <br> - The best place to chat about the game is the official Discord server. <br>Thank you for playing, I hope you enjoy the game! :) <br>  Mirko
